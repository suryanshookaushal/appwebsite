	<h1> Logic programming paradigms </h1>
	<p>It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc. In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. In normal programming languages, such concept of knowledge base is not available but while using the concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning we have some models like Perception model which is using the same mechanism.
In logical programming the main emphasize is on knowledge base and the problem. The execution of the program is very much like proof of mathematical statement, e.g., Prolog.</p>
	<ol>ADVANTAGES
		<li>Very simple to implement</li>
		<li>It contains loops, variables etc.</li>
	</ol>
	<ol>DISADVANTAGES
        <LI>Complex problem cannot be solved</LI>
        <li>Less efficient and less productive</li>
        <li>Parallel programming is not possible</li>
    </ol>
