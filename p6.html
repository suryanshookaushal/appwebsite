	<h1> Parallel processing approach –</h1>
	<p>Parallel processing is the processing of program instructions by dividing them among multiple processors. A parallel processing system posses many numbers of processor with the objective of running a program in less time by dividing them. This approach seems to be like divide and conquer. Examples are NESL (one of the oldest one) and C/C++ also supports because of some library function..</p>
	<ol>ADVANTAGES
		<li>Very simple to implement</li>
		<li>It contains loops, variables etc.</li>
	</ol>
	<ol>DISADVANTAGES
        <LI>Complex problem cannot be solved</LI>
        <li>Less efficient and less productive</li>
        <li>Parallel programming is not possible</li>
    </ol>
