	<h1> Procedural programming paradigm â€“</h1>
	<p>This paradigm emphasizes on procedure in terms of under lying machine model. There is no difference in between procedural and imperative approach. It has the ability to reuse the code and it was boon at that time when it was in use because of its reusability.</p>
	<ol>ADVANTAGES
		<li>Very simple to implement</li>
		<li>It contains loops, variables etc.</li>
	</ol>
	<ol>DISADVANTAGES
        <LI>Complex problem cannot be solved</LI>
        <li>Less efficient and less productive</li>
        <li>Parallel programming is not possible</li>
    </ol>
