	<h1> Imperative programming paradigm:</h1>
	<p>It is one of the oldest programming paradigm. It features close relation relation to machine architecture. It is based on Von Neumann architecture. It works by changing the program state through assignment statements. It performs step by step task by changing state. The main focus is on how to achieve the goal. The paradigm consist of several statements and after execution of all the result is stored.</p>
	<ol>ADVANTAGES
		<li>Very simple to implement</li>
		<li>It contains loops, variables etc.</li>
	</ol>
	<ol>DISADVANTAGES
        <LI>Complex problem cannot be solved</LI>
        <li>Less efficient and less productive</li>
        <li>Parallel programming is not possible</li>
    </ol>
