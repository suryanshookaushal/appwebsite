	<h1> Declarative programming paradigm:</h1>
	<p>It is divided as Logic, Functional, Database. In computer science the declarative programming is a style of building programs that expresses logic of computation without talking about its control flow. It often considers programs as theories of some logic.It may simplify writing parallel programs. The focus is on what needs to be done rather how it should be done basically emphasize on what code code is actually doing. It just declare the result we want rather how it has be produced. This is the only difference between imperative (how to do) and declarative (what to do) programming paradigms. Getting into deeper we would see logic, functional and database.</p>
	<ol>ADVANTAGES
		<li>Very simple to implement</li>
		<li>It contains loops, variables etc.</li>
	</ol>
	<ol>DISADVANTAGES
        <LI>Complex problem cannot be solved</LI>
        <li>Less efficient and less productive</li>
        <li>Parallel programming is not possible</li>
    </ol>
